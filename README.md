# 1688-API

 A TS SDK for accessing 1688's API, features a more "smooth" and "native" translation for API endpoints.

## Use

1. `import {YourSolutionName} from "1688-api;`
2. Initialize your solution class with your `appKey`, `secretKey`, and `access_token` from 1688.
3. Use it to your convenience.

**Please note this SDK does not grant you access to solutions or abilities that you did not purchase**
